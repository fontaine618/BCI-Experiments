BCI Experiments Scripts
========================

Component importance (4.1)
--------------------------

This folder contain the code producing the results presented in Figure 1 of the main text.

File description:
- the "results" folder contain the posterior summaries and selection criterion for the five chains.
    Naming convention: "Kx{x}_Ky{y}_seed{seed}_K{K}{quantity}" where x and y are the number of components
    in the two models, seed is the random seed used to initialize the chains, and K is the number of
    components fitted.
 - "job.sh" is the script used to run the experiments on the SLURM cluster, which runs the following five scripts:
    - "train.py": MCMC sampling of the model
    - "posterior.py": Posterior summaries
    - "importance.py": Component importance from porterior
    - "drop_one.py": BCE change when dropping one component
    - "just_one.py": BCE change when keeping only one component
 - "generate_data.py" is the script used to generate the data used in the experiments.
 - "analyze.py" is the script used to analyze the results and produce the plots.

Latent dimension selection (4.2)
--------------------------------

This folder contain the code producing the results presented in Figure 2 of the main text.

File description:
- the "results" folder contain the posterior summaries and selection criterion for the five chains.
    Naming convention: "Kx{x}_Ky{y}_seed{seed}_K{K}{quantity}" where x and y are the number of components
    in the two models, seed is the random seed used to initialize the chains, and K is the number of
    components fitted.
 - "job.sh" is the script used to run the experiments on the SLURM cluster, which runs the following five scripts:
    - "train.py": MCMC sampling of the model
    - "mllk.py": Training predictive likelihood estimation
    - "ic_x.py": Information criterion for X|Y
    - "ic_y.py": Information criterion for Y|X
    - "test.py": Testing metrics
 - "oracle.py" is the script used to compute the oracle prediction metrics.
 - "generate_data.py" is the script used to generate the data used in the experiments.
 - "analyze.py" is the script used to analyze the results and produce the plots.

Variants comparison (C.1)
-------------------------

This folder contain the code producing the results presented in Figures S4-7 of the supplementary material.

File description:
- the "results" folder contain the posterior summaries and selection criterion for the five chains.
    Naming convention: "Kx{x}_Ky{y}_seed{seed}_model{truemodel}_model{fittedmodel}" where x and y are the number of components
    in the two models, seed is the random seed used to initialize the chains, and truemodel and fittedmodel are the
    models used to generate and fit the data, espectively.
 - "job.sh" is the script used to run the experiments on the SLURM cluster, which runs the following five scripts:
    - "train.py": MCMC sampling of the model
    - "mllk.py": Training predictive likelihood estimation
    - "ic_x.py": Information criterion for X|Y
    - "ic_y.py": Information criterion for Y|X
    - "predict.py": Testing metrics
 - "generate_data.py" is the script used to generate the data used in the experiments.
 - "analyze.py" is the script used to analyze the results and produce the S4, S5 and S6 figures.
 - "estimation.py" is the script used to analyze the results and produce the S7 figure.

Real data analyses (5, D)
-------------------------

This folder contain the code producing the results presented in Figures 3-6 of the main text
and Figures S9-18 of the supplementary material.

File description:
- The various experiments are recognizable by the leading letter of the file name:
    - C: correlation (Figure 4, third column)
    - K: number of components (Figure 4, second column)
    - R: comparison for prediction (Figure S9)
    - S: estimation for various subjects (Figures 3, 5, 6, S10-18)
    - V: variants comparison (Figure 4, first column)
